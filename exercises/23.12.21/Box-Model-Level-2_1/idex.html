        There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! It's toe-tappingly
        tragic! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Quite possible. We live long and are
        celebrated poopers. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting
        down with your children, and hitting them?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. And then the battle's not
        so bad? You guys go on without me!
        <strong> I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!</strong>
        <em> It's okay, Bender.</em> I like cooking too.
      </p>
      <div id="h2">
        <h2 class="cntr-text">Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</h2>

        Tell her she looks thin. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto
        your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I
        was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were
        there, and you were there!
      </p>
      <div class="algn-center">
        <ol>
          <li>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</li>
          <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>
          <li>
            Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred
            to as "the brig".
          </li>

        Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Morbo will now introduce
        tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and
        Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to
        that or we walk!
      </p>
      <div class="algn-center">
        <ul>
          <li>A true inspiration for the children.</li>
          <li>It's a T. It goes "tuh".</li>
          <li>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be
        right. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Large
        bet on myself in round one. And yet you haven't said what I told you to
        say! How can any of us trust you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death
        sphere? Ooh, name it after me! We don't have a brig. I suppose I could
        part with 'one' and still be feared… Shinier than yours, meatbag.
